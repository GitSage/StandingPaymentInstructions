<h4>Standing Payment</h4>
<p>The source for this site is available on GitHub <a href="">here</a>.</p>
<p>To run it yourself, you'll need to download <a href="https://github.com/GitSage/StandingPaymentInstructions/archive/master.zip">the zip file</a>, extract it, and serve it with a web server such as Apache. Unfortunately, you won't be able to just run the file in your browser, since Angular demands an HTTP environment.</p>
